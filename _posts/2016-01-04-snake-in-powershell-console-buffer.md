As a part of &#8220;discovering&#8221; PowerShell, I had an idea to quickly wrap-up a classic snake game. So.. despite of having lots of more urgent tasks on my head at that moment, I of course decided to sacrifice few hours to this task. The result is this:

![PowerSnake window]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/powersnake1.jpg)

The game can be started with 5 different speeds. So far no &#8220;maps&#8221; (obstacles) but that may come in the future (to be honest, I am afraid that I&#8217;ll waste even more time on this project).

The [code](http://poshcode.org/2898) to quickly deal with console buffer that I&#8217;ve found on [poshcode.com](http://poshcode.com) was of great help.

The game&#8217;s code can be found on my github: <https://github.com/spitfire05/PowerSnake>
