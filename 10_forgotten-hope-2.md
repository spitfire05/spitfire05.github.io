[Forgotten Hope 2](http://fhmod.org) is an award-winning full-conversion modification for Battlefield 2 game, aiming to be a historically accurate first-person shooter set in the times of second world war. I joined the team of FH devs in 2010 and up to 2014 I was responsible for all kinds of programming tasks, such as fine-coding ingame assets, improving and managing the release pipeline, constantly improving in-game gamelogic Python scripts and creating various tools for other developers to use. Working with FH devs team allowed me to gather vast amounts of experience in wokring on a top-notch FPS game in a world-wide team of hobbyist and professionals. It was also great opportunity to meet really great people. Thank you guys!
